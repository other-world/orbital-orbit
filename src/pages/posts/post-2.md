After a successful first session learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

I'm also adding links to resources that look useful along the way:

- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- [What are browser developer tools? MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)
- [YAML Formatter](https://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html)
